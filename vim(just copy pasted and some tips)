 Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
  The format for a delete command with the  d  delete operator is as follows:

        d   motion

  Where:
    d      - is the delete operator.
    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of motions:
    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

     where:
       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),

     To substitute phrases between two line #'s type       :#,#s/old/new/g
     To substitute all occurrences in the file type        :%s/old/new/g
     To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'             :%s/old/new/gc
