*Response headers can be very important. They can often tell you something about the web server sending them, or give you cookies that may prove useful later on.*

By default, cURL will perform GET requests on whatever URL you supply it, such as:

curl https://tryhackme.com

This would retrieve the main page for tryhackme with a GET request. Using command line flags for cURL, we can do a lot more than just GET content. The -X flag allows us to specify the request type, eg -X POST. You can specify the data to POST with --data, which will default to plain text data. It's worth mentioning cURL does not store cookies, and you have to manually specify any cookies and values that you would like to send with your request. If you want to send cookies from cURL, you can look up how to do this.

Remember, cookies are not shared between different browsers (I'm counting cURL as a browser here).
