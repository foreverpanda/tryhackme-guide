so this was an intresting room! most of the hashes were cracked using online tools such as crackstation cyberchef and dcode

LEVEL1: 

this is an easy task used crack station to crack all of them

(in this one i used hashcat hash types page to look what kind of hash is this! just visit that page use ctrl+f and type the starting of the hash $2 you will see some of the hashes and try to figure out which one is you are looking for)

 after getting the module number i just used hashcat to crack this

  hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt

So this was a little tricky i know that this is hash is used in storing unix passwords!
so what i did was tryed to echo it out in one of txt file and use 1800 to crack this but this didnt worked for me!
so i cat outed my shadow file and saw the format it was like something this!

username:passwordhash:lastchanged:minimun:maximum:warn:inactive:expire

so this kind of format is what hashcat is expecting from us to cracck the password you
can also just remove the hash and put this hash and pass it in hashcat or replicate the format and crack the hash

after creating a new hashtype of this hash 

alex:$6$aReallyHardSalt$6WKUTqzq.UQQmrm0p/T7MPpMbGNnzXPMAXi4bJMl9be.cfi3/qxIf.hsGpS41BqMhSrHVXgMpdjS6xeKZAs02.:13064:0:9999:7:::


something like this i saved this into a text file and stated hashcat on it

hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist and it cracked the password for me took sometime

3.) Hash: e5d8870e5bdd26602cab8dbe07a942c8669e56d6:tryhackme

Solution: This hash also cannot be cracked using online tool due to the present of salt ( tryhackme ). This only can be done by using hashcat with mode -m 110.
