website which we can use if sublister isnt working is  : https://dnsdumpster.com/


What switch can we use to set our target domain to perform recon on?

-d


How about setting which engines we'll use for searching? (i.e. google, bing, etc)

-e


Saving our output is important both so we don't have to run recon again but also so we can return to our returns and review them at a later time. What switch do we use to define an output file?

-o


Sublist3r can sometimes take some time to run but we can speed through up the use of threads. Which switch allows us to set the number of threads?

-t


Last but not least, we can also bruteforce the domains for our target. This isn't always the most useful, however, it can sometimes find a key domain that we might have missed. What switch allows us to enable brute forcing?
