In this machine i just deployed it and visited the web page !

saw that there are almost 3 articles present in the main page!
visited the first page and saw the url

http://10.10.130.51/article?name=hacking


so here the parameter name is fetching a page named hacking
i though of using lfi here only and did /etc/passwd without any dir traversal it showed me 
error! i though of doing dir traversal this time! and after going to the 3 directories back! 

http://10.10.130.51/article?name=/../../../etc/passwd

i got the /etc/passwd file from where i got a username and a password

just tried to ssh into the machine and i was successful

first thing i though of doing is see the sudo perms the user has with "sudo -l"
the user can run socat with root user priv went to gtfo bins and got the command to get sudo with socat 

sudo socat stdin exec:/bin/sh

not i am the root user got the user and root flag! bingo! :)
