CC STEGANOGRAPHY

this is the only room which i had done earlier and helped me alot to learn about stego! 
the first time i did this room was by looking into the weiteups but lets see this time


TASK2  : 

almost all the answers were written in the help of the steghide which can be seen like this

steghide --help

embed
-ef
-cf
-p
extract
-sf
stehide extract -sf jpeg1.jpeg
pinguftw


TASK3 : 

--lsb
--msb
-v
-E
zsteg filename

and this only gives you the answer

nootnoot$
b1,bgr,lsb,xy


TASK4 : 


exiftool filename

Hello :)


TASK5   : 

-meta

-steghide

-extractLSB

for this i was confused which option to choose i just did this

stegoveritas filename

this will do all the thing for you and give you answer now i went to results directory and in the end there was a file with .bin ext just cat out the file andd you will see the asnwer


TASK6 : 

Sonic Visualizer

From there click File->Open and then select the included wav1 file 

From there click Layer->Add Spectrogram

answer is google




============================


EXAM PART


i visited the website and saw a image downloaded it and tried steghide with no password nothing happend after that tried exif tool

exiftool filename

it gave me somthing like this


Document Name                   : password=admin


i think thiss is the key

but it didnt worked out then i used! the admin to use it as the steghide passphrase annd i got a file key
steghide extract -sf exam1.jpeg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "a.txt".

cat a.txt 
the key is: superkeykey


for task two i just opened sonic visualiser and added a  layer of psectogram on the wav file and i got this link from that i viisted this link

zsteg scan and i got the key

zsteg file
